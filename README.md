# Digit Sum Calculator

## Description

This project includes two methods for calculating the sum of the digits of a positive integer until a single digit is obtained. The implemented methods are:

1. **`sum_digits`**: Calculates the sum of the digits repeatedly until a single digit is obtained.
2. **`digital_root`**: Calculates the digital root of a number using an efficient mathematical formula.
